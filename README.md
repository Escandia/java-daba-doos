## Mini-games website 
  Developed with HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
  Based on the aesthetics of the Flintstones.
  + The first game is to guess a number between 1 and 99.
  + The second game is to memorize pairs of photos of the same people that appear on the cards.
  + The third one is a quizz, but only able to play for members of Adalab, because it is a joke.
