Mini-games website developed with HTML, CSS and Javascript, based on the aesthetics of the Flintstones.
The first game is to guess a number between 1 and 99.
The second game is to memorize pairs of photos of the same people that appear on the cards.
The third one is a quizz, but only able to play for members of Adalab, because it is a joke.
